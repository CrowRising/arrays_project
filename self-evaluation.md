# Self Eval.

- I feel pretty confident with arrays! I defintely forget to add " for strings, but I quickly remedy that.

- I would liek to understand the uses of syntax a little more in depth, but I am also trusting the process as I have seen how well each lesson builds on the next.

- My question is more of wanting to see the arrays in action. Get a visual on how they really function irl. I get the *concept* but would liek to see it in **action**.
